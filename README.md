# ‚õ∫Ô∏è Tent: Fully Test-Time Adaptation by Entropy Minimization

This is the official project repository for [Tent: Fully-Test Time Adaptation by Entropy Minimization](https://openreview.net/forum?id=uXl3bZLkr3c) by
Dequan Wang\*, Evan Shelhamer\*, Shaoteng Liu, Bruno Olshausen, and Trevor Darrell (ICLR 2021, spotlight).

Tent equips a model to adapt itself to new and different data ‚òÄÔ∏è üåß ‚ùÑÔ∏è  during testing.
Tent updates online and batch-by-batch to reduce error on dataset shifts like corruptions, simulation-to-real discrepancies, and other differences between training and testing data.

Please check back soon for our **reference code** to reproduce and extend tent!
