# ‚õ∫Ô∏è Tent: Fully Test-Time Adaptation by Entropy Minimization

This is the official project repository for [Tent: Fully-Test Time Adaptation by Entropy Minimization](https://openreview.net/forum?id=uXl3bZLkr3c) by

Tent equips a model to adapt itself to new and different data ‚òÄÔ∏è üåß ‚ùÑÔ∏è  during testing.
Tent updates online and batch-by-batch to reduce error on dataset shifts like corruptions, simulation-to-real discrepancies, and other differences between training and testing data.

Our **example code** illustrates the method and provides representative results for image corruptions on CIFAR-10-C.
Note that the exact details of the model, optimization, etc. differ from the paper, so this is not for reproduction, but for explanation.

Please check back soon for our **reference code** to reproduce and extend tent!

## Example: Adapting to Image Corruptions on CIFAR-10-C

This example compares a baseline without adaptation (base), test-time normalization that updates feature statistics during testing (norm), and our method for entropy minimization during testing (tent).

- Dataset: [CIFAR-10-C](https://github.com/hendrycks/robustness/), with 15 corruption types and 5 levels.
- Model: [WRN-28-10](https://github.com/RobustBench/robustbench), the default model for RobustBench.

**Usage**:

```python
python cifar10c.py --cfg cfgs/base.yaml
python cifar10c.py --cfg cfgs/norm.yaml
python cifar10c.py --cfg cfgs/tent.yaml
```

**Result**: tent reduces the error (%) across corruption types at the most severe level of corruption (level 5).
