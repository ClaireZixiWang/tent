# ‚õ∫Ô∏è Tent: Fully Test-Time Adaptation by Entropy Minimization

This is the official project repository for [Tent: Fully-Test Time Adaptation by Entropy Minimization](https://openreview.net/forum?id=uXl3bZLkr3c) by

‚õ∫Ô∏è Tent equips a model to adapt itself to new and different data during testing ‚òÄÔ∏è üåß ‚ùÑÔ∏è.
Tented models adapt online and batch-by-batch to reduce error on dataset shifts like corruptions, simulation-to-real discrepancies, and other differences between training and testing data.
This kind of adaptation is effective and efficient: tent makes just one update per batch to not interrupt inference.

To illustrate the tent method and fully test-time adaptation setting we provide **example code** for adapting to image corruptions on CIFAR-10-C.
The purpose of the example is explanation, not reproduction: exact details of the model architecture, optimization settings, etc. may differ from the paper.
That said, the results should be representative, so do give it a try and experiment!

Please check back soon for **reference code** to exactly reproduce the ImageNet-C results in the paper.

## Example: Adapting to Image Corruptions on CIFAR-10-C

This example compares a baseline without adaptation (source), test-time normalization for updating feature statistics during testing (norm), and our method for entropy minimization during testing (tent).

- Dataset: [CIFAR-10-C](https://github.com/hendrycks/robustness/), with 15 corruption types and 5 levels.
- Model: [WRN-28-10](https://github.com/RobustBench/robustbench), the default model for RobustBench.

**Usage**:

```python
python cifar10c.py --cfg cfgs/source.yaml
python cifar10c.py --cfg cfgs/norm.yaml
python cifar10c.py --cfg cfgs/tent.yaml
```

**Result**: tent reduces the error (%) across corruption types at the most severe level of corruption (level 5).
